Please create a file named `allergy-form-template.xlsx` in the root of your project. This file should be an Excel spreadsheet with the same layout as the screenshot you provided. I will use this as a template to populate the allergy data.

Specifically, it should have:
- A cell where I can put the week's date range (e.g., "WEEK 2 - 09/06/25 - 13/06/25").
- The title "Food Allergens & Intolerances : Ingredient List".
- The allergen headers (Celery, Gluten, etc.).
- The day headers (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).

I will populate the food items and the checkmarks in the corresponding cells. Let me know when you have created this file.
