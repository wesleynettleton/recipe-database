That is an excellent point, and very likely the cause of the problem. My code is currently set to always write to the very first sheet in the Excel file.

Could you please tell me the exact name of the sheet that has the allergy form layout?

Once I have the name, I'll update the code to specifically target that sheet, and the export should work correctly.
